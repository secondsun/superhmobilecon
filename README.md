# SuperH Mobile Con

This is a demo everything for a proof of concept application that tries to recreate as much of the IOSchedule 2017 experience using Open Source technologies.

# Server
This is the directory of server components.  Eventually it will include a Auth service powered by Keycloak, push messaging powered by AeroGear Unified Push, a WildflySwarm and OpenWhisk api platform, and be deployable on docker and OpenShift.

# Android
This is the Android client portion of the application.
